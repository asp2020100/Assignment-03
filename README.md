Building a portfolio webpage - Part 02<br>
Task 06:<br>

Now that you have built the foundation of your portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS, it's time
to add interactivity using JavaScript. Your task is to enhance your webpage by incorporating the
following features:<br>
1. Dynamic Content: Use JavaScript to dynamically update the content of your webpage. For
example, you could include a button that toggles the visibility of additional information
about your projects or achievements.<br>
2. Image Slider: Create an image slider using JavaScript. It should allow users to view
multiple images related to your theme. The slider can automatically cycle through the
images or provide navigation controls for users to browse through them.<br>
3. Form Validation: Implement form validation using JavaScript to ensure that the
information provided by users through contact forms is valid. Validate fields such as email
addresses, phone numbers, or any other relevant information.<br>
4. Smooth Scrolling: Add smooth scrolling functionality to your navigation links. When a user
clicks on a navigation link, the page should scroll smoothly to the corresponding section
instead of instantly jumping to it.<br>
5. Event Handling: Utilize event handling in JavaScript to create interactive elements. For
example, you can add hover effects to your portfolio items, create tooltips or pop-ups
when users interact with specific elements, or implement click events for interactive
buttons.<br>
6. Custom Animations: Use JavaScript to create custom animations that enhance the user
experience. This could include animated transitions between sections, fade-in effects for
elements as they come into view, or any other creative animations that suit your portfolio
theme.<br><br>

Remember, the goal of this task is not just to incorporate JavaScript but to do so in a way that
enhances the user experience and adds value to your portfolio webpage. Be creative and think
about how interactivity can improve the overall presentation of your work.
Consider how your webpage looks and functions across different devices and screen sizes.
Ensure that it remains responsive and accessible, providing a consistent experience to users on
various platforms.<br>
Task 07: Submit Your Portfolio Webpage<br>
To submit your portfolio webpage, you need to upload it to an online repository. Follow the
instructions below to complete this task:<br>
1. Set up an Online Repository: Create an account on a platform such as GitHub, GitLab, or
Bitbucket. If you already have an account, you can use it for this assignment.<br>
2. Create a New Repository: Once you are logged in, create a new repository specifically for
your portfolio webpage. Give it a suitable name.<br>
3. Upload Your Files: In the repository, upload all the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other
related files that are part of your portfolio webpage. Make sure to maintain the file
structure you have created for your project.<br>
4. Provide a README: Include a README file that provides a brief description of your
portfolio webpage, explains the theme you chose, and mentions any additional features
you have implemented.<br>
5. Commit and Push: Commit your changes and push them to the online repository. This
step will vary depending on the platform you are using, but typically involves selecting the
files, writing a commit message, and pushing the changes.<br>
6. Obtain the Repository Link: Once your files are uploaded and pushed, navigate to the main
page of your repository. Look for a button or section that provides a link to your repository.<br>
7. Submission: Finally, submit your assignment by pasting the link to your online repository
in the text area provided at the Assignment Submission page.<br>
Make sure to double-check the repository link before submitting to ensure it is accessible and
that the correct files are included<br>
Ensure that your repository is set to public or provide appropriate access permissions if it is a
private repository, so that I can access your work.
